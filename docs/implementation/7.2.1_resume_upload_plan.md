# Resume Upload Enhancement Plan - Phase 7.2.1
**Focus**: Enable job seekers to upload resumes when applying for jobs using Supabase Storage

## 🎯 Current State Analysis

### ✅ Already Implemented
- **Database Schema**: `job_applications` table with `resume_file_path` field
- **Storage Infrastructure**: Supabase Storage bucket `resumes` with proper RLS policies
- **Backend Operations**: Complete resume storage utilities in `src/lib/storage/resume-storage.ts`
- **Application System**: Basic job application functionality without resume upload
- **Security**: Row Level Security policies for resume access control

### ❌ Missing Components  
- **File Upload UI Component**: No reusable file upload component
- **Enhanced Application Form**: Current apply button only creates basic applications
- **Resume Upload Integration**: No UI to select and upload resumes during application
- **Resume Management**: No way for users to manage their uploaded resumes
- **Application Form Modal**: Missing comprehensive application form with resume upload

## 📋 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core File Upload Component (Priority: High)

#### 1.1 Create File Upload UI Component
**File**: `src/components/ui/file-upload.tsx`

#### 2.2 Implement Application Flow
**Workflow**:
1. User clicks "Apply Now"
2. Modal opens with application form
3. User fills cover letter (required)
4. User uploads resume (optional)
5. File validation and upload to Supabase Storage
6. Application record created with resume file path
7. Success feedback and modal closure

### Phase 3: Resume Management (Priority: Medium)

**Features**:
- Display current resume status in user profile
- Upload new resume functionality
- Download/preview current resume
- Delete resume with confirmation
- Resume usage tracking (which applications used this resume)

#### 3.2 Application History Enhancement
**File**: `src/components/applications/applications-list.tsx` (modify existing)

**Enhancements**:
- Show resume attachment status for each application
- Download resume link for applications with resumes
- Resume file name and upload date display

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Priority: Low)

#### 4.1 Multiple Resume Support
- Allow users to maintain multiple resume versions
- Resume naming and categorization
- Select appropriate resume per application

#### 4.2 Resume Preview Integration
- In-browser PDF preview
- Resume thumbnail generation
- Quick preview in application modal

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### File Upload Security
```typescript
// Validation rules (already implemented in resume-storage.ts)
- File types: PDF, DOC, DOCX only
- Size limit: 2MB maximum
- Naming pattern: {userId}/resume_{timestamp}.{extension}
- Upload method: Presigned URLs for security
```

### Storage Bucket Configuration
```sql
-- Already exists in migration 20250831000003_setup_resume_storage.sql
Bucket: 'resumes'
Public: false (private access only)
Size limit: 2MB
MIME types: PDF, DOC, DOCX
RLS policies: Users access own files, employers access applicant files
```

### Database Schema Integration
```sql
-- Existing job_applications table structure
job_applications {
  id: UUID
  job_id: UUID (FK to jobs)
  applicant_id: UUID (FK to auth.users)  
  cover_letter: TEXT
  resume_file_path: TEXT (Supabase storage path)
  status: application_status_enum
  applied_at: TIMESTAMP
  updated_at: TIMESTAMP
}
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Design Specifications

### Application Form Modal
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Apply for: Senior Developer         │
│ Company: Tech Corp                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Cover Letter * (50-2000 chars)     │
│ ┌─────────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ Tell us why you're interested   │ │
│ │ in this position...             │ │
│ │                                 │ │
│ └─────────────────────────────────┘ │
│ 1,245/2000 characters              │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Resume (Optional - PDF, DOC, DOCX) │
│ ┌─────────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │  📎 Drag & drop or browse       │ │
│ │     files (Max 2MB)             │ │
│ └─────────────────────────────────┘ │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│              [Cancel] [Submit]      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### File Upload States
- **Empty**: Drag & drop zone with browse button
- **Selected**: File name, size, remove button
- **Uploading**: Progress bar with percentage
- **Uploaded**: Success checkmark with file details
- **Error**: Error message with retry option

## 🔄 Integration Points

### Authentication Integration
- Use existing `useAuth()` hook for user context
- Respect `isJobSeeker` and `isEmployer` flags
- Redirect unauthenticated users to login

### Toast Notifications
- Use existing `useToast()` hook for user feedback
- Success: "Application submitted successfully!"
- Error: "Failed to upload resume. Please try again."
- Validation: "Please fill in all required fields."

### Form Validation
- Cover letter: 50-2000 characters (required)
- Resume: PDF/DOC/DOCX, max 2MB (optional)
- Duplicate application prevention
- Real-time validation feedback

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```typescript
// File upload component tests
- File type validation
- Size limit enforcement  
- Upload progress tracking
- Error state handling

// Application form tests
- Form validation rules
- Cover letter character limits
- Resume upload integration
- Duplicate application prevention
```

### Integration Tests  
```typescript
// End-to-end application flow
- Complete application submission
- Resume upload and storage
- Application record creation
- Permission and security validation
```

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Happy Path**: Complete application with resume upload
2. **Cover Letter Only**: Application without resume
3. **Invalid Files**: Wrong file types, oversized files
4. **Network Errors**: Upload failures, timeout handling
5. **Permissions**: Employer trying to apply, unauthenticated access
