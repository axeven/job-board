# Job Board Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the high-level implementation plan for the Mini Job Board application, focusing on delivering core features incrementally with a robust foundation.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Database Setup

### 1.1 Supabase Database Schema
**Priority: Critical**
- Create `jobs` table with columns:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `title` (text, required)
  - `company` (text, required)
  - `description` (text, required)
  - `location` (text, required)
  - `job_type` (enum: 'Full-Time', 'Part-Time', 'Contract')
  - `user_id` (UUID, foreign key to auth.users)
  - `created_at` (timestamp)
  - `updated_at` (timestamp)

### 1.2 Row Level Security (RLS)
- Enable RLS on jobs table
- Policy: Users can read all jobs
- Policy: Users can insert/update/delete only their own jobs

### 1.3 Environment Configuration
- Set up `.env.local` with Supabase credentials
- Configure Supabase client in `lib/supabase.ts`
- Add TypeScript types for database schema

## Phase 2: Authentication System

### 2.1 Supabase Auth Setup
- Configure auth middleware for route protection
- Set up auth callback handling
- Create auth context for global state management

### 2.2 Authentication Components
- `LoginForm` component with email/password
- `SignupForm` component with validation
- `AuthButton` for login/logout toggle
- Loading and error states

### 2.3 Authentication Pages
- `/auth/login` - Login page
- `/auth/signup` - Registration page
- `/auth/callback` - OAuth callback handler
- Redirect logic for protected routes

## Phase 3: Core Job Management

### 3.1 Public Job Listing (`/jobs`)
- Server-side rendering with Supabase data fetching
- Job card components with key information
- Responsive grid layout
- Search functionality (bonus)

### 3.2 Job Filtering System
- Filter by location (dropdown/autocomplete)
- Filter by job type (checkbox/radio buttons)
- URL state management for shareable filters
- Reset filters functionality

### 3.3 Job Detail Page (`/jobs/[id]`)
- Dynamic route with job ID parameter
- Full job details display
- Apply button/contact information
- Back to listings navigation
- 404 handling for invalid job IDs

### 3.4 Job Creation (`/post-job`)
- Protected route (authentication required)
- Form with validation using React Hook Form
- Rich text editor for job description
- Form submission with error handling
- Success redirect to dashboard

## Phase 4: User Dashboard

### 4.1 Dashboard Layout (`/dashboard`)
- Protected route with auth middleware
- Navigation sidebar/tabs
- User profile section
- Job statistics overview

### 4.2 My Jobs Management
- List of user's posted jobs
- Job status indicators (active/draft)
- Quick actions (edit, delete, view)
- Empty state for no jobs

### 4.3 Job Editing
- Pre-populated edit form
- Update functionality with optimistic updates
- Cancel/save actions
- Validation and error handling

### 4.4 Job Deletion
- Confirmation modal/dialog
- Soft delete vs hard delete consideration
- Success feedback
- List update after deletion

## Phase 5: UI/UX Enhancement

### 5.1 Design System
- Consistent color palette and typography
- Component library with Tailwind CSS
- Responsive breakpoints strategy
- Dark mode support (optional)

### 5.2 Loading & Error States
- Skeleton loaders for data fetching
- Loading spinners for form submissions
- Toast notifications for success/error messages
- Error boundaries for crash recovery

### 5.3 Performance Optimization
- Image optimization for company logos
- Code splitting for route-based chunks
- Caching strategy for job listings
- SEO meta tags and structured data

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
1. **Database First**: Set up schema and test with sample data
2. **Component Driven**: Build reusable UI components
3. **Feature Complete**: Implement full feature before moving to next
4. **Test Early**: Add basic tests for critical paths
5. **Deploy Often**: Use Vercel for continuous deployment

### Technical Considerations
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode with proper typing
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and user feedback
- **Security**: Input validation and sanitization
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance for forms and navigation
- **Performance**: Lazy loading and code splitting

### Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 2-3 days
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 days
- **Phase 3**: 4-5 days
- **Phase 4**: 3-4 days
- **Phase 5**: 2-3 days

**Total Estimated Time**: 14-19 days
